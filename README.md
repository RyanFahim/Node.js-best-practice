# Node.js best practice

This is a Node.js example code for the best practices of Node.js. 
 [Inspired by](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices)

## About the project
In this project , mongoDB is used as the database. There is only one model named User where the CRUD is applied following the best practice of Node js

#### N.B. Soon MySql will also be added

 ## Installation

 First open your terminal and clone the repository
  
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RyanFahim/Node.js-best-practice.git
  ```

  After cloning the repository, change the directory to Node.js-best-practice and write "npm i" to use node modules according to your device configuration

  ```bash
  cd Node.js-best-practice
  npm i
  ```

  After installing node module run the server to start the project

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  ### How to use this code?
  This is only a boilerplate. You can clone the repository and rename it for your own purpose. If any issue or any suggestions, you can knock me at raihanfahim@gmail.com
